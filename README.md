**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room is an up-and-coming gaming company that had developed an Android based gaming app based on the 1980s television gameshow called 'Win, Lose, or Draw'. The client was looking to expand out of the Android based environment and move to a web-based platform in order to access a broader audience for their application. The game called, 'Draw it or Lose it' consists of teams going against each other to guess an image as it is rendered within the allotted time. Each round lasts 1 minute, each image is fully rendered by 30 seconds, and if the team does not guess the puzzle - the remaining teams have one guess each to solve it. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

An area I felt most comfortable when developing the required documentation was the section regarding the Domain Model and UML Diagram. It was interesting to me to work through different design patterns for Object Oriented Programming. It helped me realize how functianal it is in securing your program as well as organizing it for future modification. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Going through the process of designing the software document truly helped me better organize how I would have to implement the code. I did not realize how many considerations need to be made when deciding the direction of the project. From certain design contraints to what platform the game will be based on all need to be considered prior to the first line of code being written. This helps ensure a cohesive process throughout development.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

The part of the document I would revise is the design contraints. I had not recognized all of the considerations that need to be made to implement the program across multiple platforms. Here, I would have added more detail to certain server contraints, such as implementing REST API practices.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

For the user's needs, there is already a functioning application, so I focused on how to get their application across each platform and how to optimize it's operation. The beauty of web connected servers based on REST API is that many different platforms can communicate with the system to get what it needs through HTTP. In order to provide the best product for the customer, it is important to consider all of their needs. This helps design a system that maximizes function while keeping within what the client desires. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Prior to this course I did not consider all of what went into designing the software. I would simply code a jumbled mess that definitely did not follow certain CRUD protocols. I had never recognized certain design patterns either. These design patterns are well know and often implemented, making them incredibly useful for situations that may come up when designing software. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can implement these design patterns, saving time and money. Aside from these design patterns, I will certainly recognize the design contraints within my system a little bit more. This will also save a ton of time so I do not have to refactor code based on something that should have been known form the beginning.
